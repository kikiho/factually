toxic,"Many websites list toxic ingredients supposedly in vaccines. While some ingredients listed are technically present, explanations of their dangers are often disingenuous. Their risks are frequently emphasised in terms of larger or prolonged exposure, not acknowledging that the dose makes the poison. Nor is it mentioned that some substances occur naturally in the human body (e.g. formaldehyde), or accumulate in greater amounts through acts such as breastfeeding (e.g. aluminum).",0
injury,"Vaccines are safe and effective. Like all medicines, vaccines must go through many steps before Health Canada approves them for use. Vaccines must prove to be safe and effective at preventing the diseases they target. Once a vaccine is in use, Canadian health authorities continue to monitor for side effects and injuries. Serious side effects and injuries from vaccines are very rare.",0
autism,"There is no evidence to link any other vaccines to autism. The number of children with autism seems to have increased in recent years. This is because the diagnosis of autism now includes children with milder symptoms who would not have been included in the past. There is also greater public awareness of autism, and more parents are seeking help. Scientists recently found a gene linked to autism.",0
thimerosal,"There is no evidence linking thimerosal (a preservative once used in vaccines) to autism or any other developmental disorder. Also, thimerosal has not been used in infant and childhood vaccines for many years. Yet the numbers of children with autism continued to increase, even after thimerosal stopped being used in vaccines.",0
breastfeeding,"Breastfeeding is not a substitute for vaccination. Breastfeeding provides some protection against certain infections, especially viral respiratory infections, ear infections and diarrhea. But this protection is incomplete, temporary, and can be overcome if your baby is exposed to large amounts of a specific germ.",0
natural,"Natural is not always better. The germs that vaccines protect against are part of nature, but they are harmful. Many things in nature should not be ingested: Some of the most powerful poisons come from plants and berries. Vaccines are made from natural sources. Some vaccines are made from live germs that have undergone changes so they can't cause illness. Others contain only part of the germ that has been pulled out and purified. Vaccines stimulate our immune system the same way the infection would, but without making us sick",0
nosodes,"Nosodes are not a substitute for vaccines, and there is no scientific or medical evidence to show they prevent infectious diseases. Sometimes called homeopathic vaccines, nosodes are made using bacteria, viruses, tissue or other material from someone with a particular infection, disease or ailment. The substance is then diluted so much that little or no active ingredients are left in the final product.",0
serious,"All of the diseases that children are vaccinated against are serious. They can all cause serious illness, complications and death, even with the best medical care. Many of these diseases also have no cure.",0
need,"Many of the vaccine-preventable diseases that are uncommon in Canada still occur in other parts of the world. With travel and immigration, there is a real risk of these diseases being brought into Canada. Any child who is not vaccinated is at risk when infections are imported.",
delay,Vaccines begin at 2 months of age to protect babies as early in life as possible against diseases that can make them very sick (such as pertussis). Babies respond well to vaccines at a very young age. Side effects from vaccination are not more common in young babies than older children.,
