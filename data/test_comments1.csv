In response to the misinformation about vaccines at last nights GOP debate the AAP has issued the following statement: American Academy of Pediatrics Reiterates Safety and Importance of Vaccines The American Academy of Pediatrics would like to correct false statements made during the Republican presidential debate last night regarding vaccines. Claims that vaccines are linked to autism have been disprov.en by a robust body of medical literature. It is dangerous to public health to suggest otherwise. There is no alternative immunization schedule. Delaying vaccines only leaves a child at risk of disease for a longer period of time; it does not make vaccinating safer. Vaccines work plain and simple. Vaccines are one of the safest most effective and most important medical innovations of our time. Pediatricians partner with parents to provide what is best for their child and what is best is for children to be fully vaccinated.,0,

Personally we know many who have had vaccine injuries right?  Does anyone in my friends list know of anyone with a vaccine injury?  Do ...you have a family member with a vaccine injury? Or are you vaccine injured?  Interested to see the results of this mini-survey on this long held belief that vaccine injuries are so rare.  Ready set... GO! ;),1,injury
Vaccine Injury is not really a side effect rather it has become an effect. When 54% of children have become chronically ill from vaccines it is Not 1 in a mill...ion seizured became paralyzed or autistic from the special federal Vaccine Court in the USA. Look up VAERS-the vaccine injury reporting system (This all kept out of Pharma owned mainstream news). I rarely have had a client without Vaccine Injuries in over 10 years!,1,injury
Rare? Pfft sure Is that why 3 children we personally know and where all sent to the ER and diagnosed  with seizures from their vaccines?? Vaccine injury is not rare. They just keep most of it secret from the public.If you're worried about allergic reactions to vaccines know that they're very rare. ,1,injury
studies are needed to understand whether combined neurotoxic exposures (such as receiving both thimerosal-containing and aluminum-containing vaccines) provoke gender-specific effects.,1,"thimerosal, autism"
This study significantly associates organic mercury exposure from thimerosal in the Hepatitis B vaccine with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders.  Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder.,1,"thimerosal, autism"
The next time someone tells you there is no thimerosal in flu vaccines show them this! There is mercury in flu vaccines and any amount is too much to inject in humans! NEWSFLASH: THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A SAFE VACCINE!  #TxMFA #NVIC #VaxxedUSA #VaxxedWorld #MedicalFreedom,1,"thimerosal, autism"
Did you know that although mercury (thimerosal) has been removed from the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule since 2001 it is still contained in most flu vaccines that are administered to children on an annual basis? Cases diagnosed with atypical autism were...more likely to have received greater overall and dose-dependent exposures to Hg from TM-HepB vaccines administered within the first month two months,1,
If you are having your child vaccinated following the CDC schedule the doctor is going by your child will be given at least 18 flu vaccines before reaching 18 years old. Each flu vaccine from a multi-dose vile contains 25 mcg of thimerosal. After 18 flu shots also a known neurotoxin will help destroy your child's brain and body. This is just the flu shot. What about all of the other doses too? Think about this!,1,
